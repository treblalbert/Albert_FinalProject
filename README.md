# 📊 Video Game Data Analytics Project

## 🎮 Overview
This project combines video game development, data extraction, and advanced data analytics to analyze user behavior. The system integrates a Python application using **Tkinter** and **GPT-4** to dynamically generate insightful data visualizations based on CSV files generated by the game.

### Features
1. **Video Game Data Extraction**: The game collects player behavior data (e.g., scores, time survived, actions) and uploads it to a **Supabase** database.
2. **Data Analytics Program**: A Python GUI application powered by **Tkinter** enables users to:
   - Load game-generated CSV files.
   - Input prompts for desired plots.
   - Leverage **GPT-4** to generate Python code dynamically for creating plots using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
3. **Dynamic Plotting**: Visualizations are generated in real time based on user input and dataset columns.
4. **Dark Mode Support**: The application includes a toggle for switching between light and dark themes.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- Pip (Python Package Manager)
- Supabase Account and Project (for storing game data)

### Required Python Libraries
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openai tkinter
```

### OpenAI API Key
1. Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
2. Replace the placeholder in the code:
   ```python
   openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Game
1. Start the video game and play.
2. The game automatically extracts user data and uploads it to Supabase.

### Using the Data Analytics Tool
1. Run the Python application:
   ```bash
   python gpt_plot_app.py
   ```
2. Load the CSV file exported by the game.
3. Enter a prompt describing the desired plot (e.g., "Show a bar chart of scores vs time survived").
4. Click **Generate Plot** to see your visualization.
5. Use the **Dark Mode Toggle** for a comfortable experience.

## 🎨 Application Features

### GUI Components
- **Load CSV File**: Select a CSV file containing the game data.
- **Prompt Entry**: Input a natural language description of the plot you want.
- **Generate Plot**: Dynamically create plots using GPT-4 and display them.
- **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes for the interface.
- **Error Handling**: Logs errors to an `error_log.txt` file for debugging.

### Supported Plot Types
The application supports various plot types based on user input, including:
- Bar charts
- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Heatmaps
- Custom visualizations

## 🌟 Key Technologies

### Game
- **Supabase**: For cloud-hosted database to store extracted game data.

### Data Analytics Tool
- **Python**: Core programming language for the GUI and analytics.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: To dynamically generate Python plotting code.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating high-quality plots.

---

## 📝 Notes
1. Ensure the CSV file format matches the structure expected by the analytics tool.
2. Handle sensitive data like your OpenAI API key securely (e.g., using environment variables).
3. The application assumes that the CSV file columns correspond to player data metrics (e.g., `score`, `time_survived`).
